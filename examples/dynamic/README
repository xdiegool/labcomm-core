This directory contains an embryo of an example of how to 
generate and compile a labcomm endpoint on the fly.

NB! There is currently no connection between the files StaticPart.java, DynamicPart.java, and
TestLabCommCompiler.java

the runme.sh script builds and runs the TestLabCommCompiler, which illustrates the 
on-the-fly compilation to RAM, but is not yet connected to an actual LabComm channel
