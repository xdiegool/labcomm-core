This is a very simple example with one labcomm file (simple.lc) defining two samples.
Example source code: Encoders and decoders written in Java and C.
	Encoder.java
	Decoder.java
        example_encoder.c
        example_decoder.c
And simple scripts
	compile.sh 	- first runs the LabComm compiler and then compiles Encoder and Decoder
	run.sh 		- runs, as expected Encoder and then Decoder

the datagram directory contains the same example, but over datagram (UDP and raw etherne )protocols.

When running compile.sh, Java and C files for the two samples defined in simple.lc will
be generated in the gen directory.

run.sh will then run first the encoder, writing to encoded_data, and then the decoders written
in Java and C, respectively, reading from the previously written encoded_data.

NB! Before trying to build and run examples, make sure you have built the LabComm compiler
by running "ant jar" in the main directory (../../ seen from here) and compiled the labcomm
descriptions needed. The compile.sh script does this.
